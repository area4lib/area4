# Release Schedule

## Fixed Dates

area4 does not have a fixed number of days in between releases.

## Stable Build

area4 is released when the library is determined as "stable".
This means a maintainer has tested any new features added / functions changed.

## Minimum Delay

area4 should not be released if another release has been published within the last 3 hours.

## Maximum Delay

area4 should be released at least once a year.
This is for a few reasons:

1. Read The Docs name holding - as said in the [Policy for Abandoned Projects](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abandoned-projects.html), if we don't release at least once a year, the `area4` name may be taken away, breaking tons of URLs.
1. Deprecation - if the project is not released every now-and-then, people may assume it is deprecated.
1. Good practice - it is just general good practice.
