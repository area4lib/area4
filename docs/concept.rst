.. warning::
    If you don't understand what we mean by dividers, fear not.

We mean dividers that divide text or sections of text
in the Python console, or use cases like that.

For example:

.. code-block:: raw
    :emphasize-lines: 2

        Hello World!
    ---------------------
    Welcome to my library.

In this example, the line between the two sections would be the divider.

The great part about area4 is that it is built to be flexible.

We have all kinds of dividers, from simple text strings similar to the one from the example,
to long emoji strings, to dividers in Markdown for programs such as GitHub bots!
