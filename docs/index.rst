.. warning:: If you don't understand what we mean by dividers, fear not.

We mean dividers that divide text in the Python console, or anything you use the library for.
An example can be found here_.
(That example uses a legacy version of the library but still demonstrates what the library does.)

Make sure to view our other documentation pages for more info!

.. important:: Please read all pages before creating issues as the question may be answered here.
