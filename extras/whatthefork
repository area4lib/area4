Hello, I am here to learn GitHub. My first time here. 
Not sure if this is allowed, but thought I would put this here in the extras folder and hope it would not be in anybody's way while I learn. 
It says that a fork is created. I am not sure yet what a fork is/does. But we were watching the good life the other day. Hilarious show! it's on Netflix. And, well she says 'what the fork'. So yeah. 
Cheers, Simone
